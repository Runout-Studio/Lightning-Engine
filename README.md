## Our goal
Our goal is to make the game engine that be accessible for beginners and high-skill programmers.\
Our goal is including:
 - The engine with sub-engine idea for effective debugging and easier organize.
 - Low resource usage with smart asset manager
 - C++ program language that easy to learn, with accessible functions
 - 2D with stylish, 3D with realism; depend on usage
 - User friendliness documents, easy to read and learn
 - Access from Windows, MacOS and Linux(debian, tar.gz) natively

## Progression (2D Rendering)
- [ ] Lightning Engine (Main engine, Editor)
- [ ] Sceneful (Scene and Camera handler sub-engine)
- [ ] DecorisP (2D Post Process sub-engine)
- [ ] Vectory2D (2D Physic handler sub-engine)
- [ ] Central Sound Processor Engine (Audio sub-engine)
