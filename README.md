# Lightning Engine
Lightning Engine: Open-Source Engine for everyone, for everything.

> [!CAUTION]
> The engine have not test anywhere else, Please proceed with caution.

> [!Important]
> During it being in-development, Editor is not avalible at this time.\
> This require user to build and run without any graphical user interface.

CMake-powered game engine, running on Vulkan API with the idea of **Sub-Engine**.

> [!TIP]
> **Sub-Engine** is the standalone programs that can use as sigular program and/or component for main engine.

To clone repossitory, you can do it by:\
``git clone https://github.com/Runout-Studio/Lightning-Engine-Bare-Bone.git``

## Our goal
Our goal is to make the game engine that be accessible for beginners and high-skill programmers.\
Our goal is including:
 - The engine with Sub-Engines as components that can use outside the engine for more specific usage
 - Low resource usage with smart asset manager
 - C++ program language that easy to learn, with accessible functions
 - 2D with stylish, 3D with realism; depend on usage
 - User friendliness documents, easy to read and learn
 - Access from Windows, MacOS and Linux(debian, tar.gz) natively

## Progression (2D Rendering)
- [ ] Lightning Engine (Main engine, Editor)
- [ ] Canvastist (Scene and Camera handler sub-engine)
- [ ] ProPost2D (2D Post Process sub-engine)
- [ ] Victory2D (Vector2D and Physic handler sub-engine)
- [ ] CSPE (Audio sub-engine)
- [ ] Asset Manager
> Subjects above may change in the future.
